# PHyL v1.0
#### ✅ What is PHyL v1.0?

PHyL is an open-source, **p**arallelized, and modular modeling software for regional **hy**drologic processes and **l**andslides simulation and prediction. The PHyL mainly includes the following modules: (i) a distributed hydrological model (CREST); (ii) a regional 3D slope stability model; and (iii) a soil moisture downscaling (SMD) method. Parallel computational technique is applied for both hydrological and slope-stability modeling modules, which is further seamlessly coupled by the SMD method. An advanced storage method, visualization, and validation processes are designed to improve the post-processing of the simulation results. PHyL is therefore an advanced and user-friendly tool for regional flood-landslide disaster forecasting.
